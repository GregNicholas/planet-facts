## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Framer Motion] (https://www.framer.com/motion/) - planet animations

### What I learned

Continued learning about the usefulness of react router. Made a page for each planet, each reusing the PlanetPage component.

Adding to my experience with styled components with variables and props.

First time using framer motion for some small animations. It is a very easy to use animation library.

### Continued development

Continue exploring best practices and file structure with Styled Components and other styling methods.

### Useful resources

- [Framer Motion enter and exit animations ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odOpmAHxW7E&t=540s) - This helped as I was new to framer motion.
